Phase 2.7  Design Feasibility Check
INFO:Place:834 - Only a subset of IOs are locked. Out of 25 IOs, 22 are locked
   and 3 are not locked. If you would like to print the names of these IOs,
   please set the environment variable XIL_PAR_DESIGN_CHECK_VERBOSE to 1. 
WARNING:Place:1206 - This design contains a global buffer instance,
   <XLXI_113/q_tmp_BUFG>, driving the net, <slowclk_OBUF>, that is driving the
   following (first 30) non-clock load pins off chip.
   < PIN: slowclk.O; >
   This design practice, in Spartan-6, can lead to an unroutable situation due
   to limitations in the global routing. If the design does route there may be
   excessive delay or skew on this net. It is recommended to use a Clock
   Forwarding technique to create a reliable and repeatable low skew solution:
   instantiate an ODDR2 component; tie the .D0 pin to Logic1; tie the .D1 pin to
   Logic0; tie the clock net to be forwarded to .C0; tie the inverted clock to
   .C1. This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was
   applied on COMP.PIN <XLXI_113/q_tmp_BUFG.O> allowing your design to continue.
   This constraint disables all clock placer rules related to the specified
   COMP.PIN.
WARNING:Place:1137 - This design is not guaranteed to be routable! This design
   contains a global buffer instance, <XLXI_113/q_tmp_BUFG>, driving the net,
   <slowclk_OBUF>, that is driving the following (first 30) non-clock load pins.
   < PIN: XLXI_112/XLXI_109.A4; >
   < PIN: slowclk.O; >
   This is not a recommended design practice in Spartan-6 due to limitations in
   the global routing that may cause excessive delay, skew or unroutable
   situations.  It is recommended to only use a BUFG resource to drive clock
   loads. Please pay extra attention to the timing and routing of this path to
   ensure the design goals are met. This is normally an ERROR but the
   CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on COMP.PIN
   <XLXI_113/q_tmp_BUFG.O> allowing your design to continue. This constraint
   disables all clock placer rules related to the specified COMP.PIN.

Phase 4.2  Initial Placement for Architecture Specific Features

......
WARNING:Place:1109 - A clock IOB / BUFGMUX clock component pair have been found
   that are not placed at an optimal clock IOB / BUFGMUX site pair. The clock
   IOB component <button_m> is placed at site <B8>. The corresponding BUFG
   component <button_m_IBUF_BUFG> is placed at site <BUFGMUX_X3Y14>. There is
   only a select set of IOBs that can use the fast path to the Clocker buffer,
   and they are not being used. You may want to analyze why this problem exists
   and correct it. This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE
   constraint was applied on COMP.PIN <button_m.PAD> allowing your design to
   continue. This constraint disables all clock placer rules related to the
   specified COMP.PIN. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may
   lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition
   be corrected in the design.

  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.

  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
